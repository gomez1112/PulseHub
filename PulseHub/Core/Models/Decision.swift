/// A record representing a decision made within an organization or meeting context.
/// 
/// The `Decision` model captures key attributes related to an organizational or team decision, 
/// including the decisionâ€™s title, details, date, impact, rationale, effectiveness, and reflection. 
/// It optionally links to a related `Meeting`, enabling historical tracking and contextual reference.
///
/// - Properties:
///   - title: The main title or summary of the decision.
///   - detail: Additional descriptive information about the decision.
///   - dateMade: The date when the decision was made.
///   - nextSteps: Any follow-up actions or steps resulting from the decision.
///   - impact: The assessed level of impact associated with the decision (see `ImpactLevel`).
///   - rationale: The reasoning or justification behind the decision.
///   - wasEffective: An optional boolean indicating whether the decision proved effective.
///   - reflection: Notes or reflections on the outcome or process of the decision.
///   - meeting: An optional reference to the meeting where the decision was made.
///
/// - Note: 
///   `Decision` provides sample data for preview and development purposes via the 
///   static `samples` property.
